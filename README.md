# DXR-Path-Tracer
The application is built using the source code from "Uno Game Engine", which follows the same engine structure as defined in the book "3D Game Programming with DirectX 12" by Frank D. Luna.
Ray tracing has been implemented following NVIDIA's tutorials and uses a version of their libraries modified by me.
